This folder contains a K6 test workflow file, `basic-k6.yaml` which automates running K6 load tests in your environment. We will use this repo as part of and ArgoCD application.

## Folder Contents

- `basic-k6.yaml`: The K6 test workflow file for aload testing.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the workflow, ensure you have the following:

- ArgoCD installed and configured in your Kubernetes cluster.
- Testkube installed and configured in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps to Configure

Follow these steps to set up and configure the K6 test workflow with ArgoCD:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new ArgoCD application for the K6 test workflow - *this allows ArgoCD to track the test.yaml file and deploy the workflow to your Kubernetes cluster*.
3. After the application is created, sync it with your repository to deploy the workflow.
4. Monitor the deployment using ArgoCDâ€™s web UI or CLI.
5. Once the workflow is deployed, you can trigger the test workflow using testkube cli or dashboard.
